# About Me
I am a resident physician and scientist at [Charité](https://www.dhzc.charite.de/) in Berlin with a deep passion for healthcare, life sciences research, and data science. 

My career began in basic neuroscience, where I investigated neuronal development and signaling —first at the level of cell assemblies, and later at the subcellular scale, focusing on individual synapses. With a strong methodological focus on electrophysiology and a desire to translate findings to improve healthcare led me into clinical training.

Today, I’m pursuing a specialization in cardiology, with a particular interest in arrhythmic disorders and the heart’s electrical conduction system.

# 🚀 Ambitions
As I transition into cardiology, I bring with me:
- A rigorous foundation in cellular biology and systems physiology 🧬 
- A strong methodological background in electrophysiology ⚡️🫀 
- A growing expertise in data-driven healthcare and AI-based diagnostics 🤖  
- A strong drive to translate scientific insight into better patient care ❤️‍🩹
