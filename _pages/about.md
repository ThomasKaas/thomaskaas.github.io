## 🧠 Background

Physician and scientist with a deep passion for healthcare, life sciences research, and data science. I'm dedicated to advancing medical care and deepening our understanding of health and disease.

My career began in basic neuroscience, where I investigated neuronal development and signaling —first at the level of cell assemblies, and later at the subcellular scale, focusing on individual synapses. With a strong methodological focus on electrophysiology and a desire to translate findings to improve healthcare led me into clinical training.

Today, I’m pursuing a specialization in cardiology, with a particular interest in arrhythmic disorders and the heart’s electrical conduction system.
